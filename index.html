                        Thirty, flirty and thriving!  What a perfect age to make a 
                        change.  <br><br>I spent the first seven years of my career as 
                        an Electrical Engineer - a respectable and important role to be 
                        sure - but not one that fit quite as snug as I would have liked.
                        <br><br>Enter coding:  What a world!  Logic, problem solving, 
                        creativity and hands-on work all packed into one role!  Now this
                        is more like it.
